# Project Description

The objective of this assignment was to alter starter code to produce an interactive app that runs in the browser and allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day. Features include dynamically updating HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The Moment.js library was also utilized to manage the date and time aspects of the planner.

The user should experience the following while utilizing the planner...

> > - the display of the current day and time at the top of the calendar.
>
> > - color-coded timeblocks for standard business hours that indicate whether the blocks are in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green).
>
> > - the ability to enter an event or task when selecting a timeblock.
>
> > - having the task/event saved to local storage when clicking the save button for that timeblock.
>
> > - having the saved tasks/events persist through page refreshes.
